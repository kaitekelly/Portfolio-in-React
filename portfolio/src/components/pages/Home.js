            <p>
            I am currently enrolled in the University of Washington's coding bootcamp certificate program and hope to find a job as a developer after completion of the course.
            Prior to this, I worked in various roles in the fashion industry including, Digital Media Manager at Nautica, and on the apparel design teams as creative coordinator to the Creative Directors of Nautica and Tommy Hilfiger.
